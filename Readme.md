# VHire Iteration 1
Many companies face challenges in conducting interviews, as their tech teams are often engaged in the interview process voluntarily, which can lead to vague and inconsistent interviews and requires too much of their bandwidth for this. To address this, we propose developing software that outsources the first or technical round of interviews. This solution will benefit both candidates and companies by offering a seamless interview experience for applicants while making it easier for companies to shortlist candidates.Additionally, it will significantly reduce the effort required from engineering teams during the technical round of the hiring process.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: For the frontend framework
- **Zegocloud**: A real-time audio and video communication service used for video conferencing.
- **Node.js**: For backend development.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling framework
- **Socket.io**: For bidirectional communication between clients and servers.
- **FireBase** : Database

## Modules
The project is divided into two main parts:

### 📦 1. `backend/`

This directory contains the backend logic for the platform. It manages api calls.

---

### 💻 2. `vhire-interview-platform/`

This directory contains the frontend codebase built using **React + TypeScript**. It includes components and pages for candidates, companies, and interviewers.
#### 📁 `src/services`:
Handles user authentication and profile management using Firebase Authentication and Firestore. It includes methods for user registration, login, profile updates, and logout.
#### 📁 `src/context`:
Provides a centralized way to manage user login/logout state across the app using Context API, including saving the user to localStorage so they stay logged in across page reloads.

##### 🔹 `candidate/`
Components specific to candidates:
- View the dashboard of the candidate
- Join interview rooms


##### 🔹 `company/`
- Schedule interviews
- View and manage interview reports

## Steps to run the application
### Steps to run the backend:
1. Clone the github repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anuksha11/VHire.git
   ```
2. Change Directory:
   ```bash
   cd VHire
   ```
3. Change the branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout iteration-2
   ```
4. To change the directory:
   ```bash
   cd vhire-it-1 
   ```
5. To change the directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```   
6. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install (to install all node modules)
   ```
7. Create a .env file in the backend directory.
8. Paste the following in the .env file(paste your gemini and one compiler api keys along with this)
   ```
   GOOGLE_GENAI_API_KEY=
   RAPIDAPI_KEY=
   RAPIDAPI_HOST=onecompiler-apis.p.rapidapi.com
   ONE_COMPILER_API_URL=https://onecompiler-apis.p.rapidapi.com/api/v1/run
   ```
9. Run the command:
   ```bash
   npm start (to run the backend)
   ```

### Open new Terminal(For Running Frontend):
1. 
   ```bash
   cd vhire-it-1 (change directotry)
   ```
